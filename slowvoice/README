After the recent join spam tactic on FreeNode and EFnet in the fall of 2018,
I needed something that voiced all users joining a moderated channel,
but it needed to randomly delay the voicing to between 60 and 99 seconds after they join.
And this is the result after looking on the internet for ideas.

The Spambots this script is made to protect against deliver their spam withing 60 seconds after join.
Since I deployed this script on the moderated channels I maintain, the spam is gone.
The spambots stil join, but they can't deliver their cargo since the channels are moderated
and they don't have voice within the timeframe they deliver their cargo.

The script has been tested on eggdrop v1.8.3. So it should work fine on this version of eggdrop and
higher. If you find any bug on this script, you can open a bug repport on Github https://github.com/solbu/eggdrop-scripts

Features:
---------
This script will voice any user who joins a channel specified after a preset minimum and maximum time.
The script also tracks nick changes, so users will get voice even if they change nick before the bot voice them.
Default is to randomly delay voice to between 60 and 99 seconds.
