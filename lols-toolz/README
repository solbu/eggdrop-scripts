Sometime in the 2000s I added this scrip to my botnet, as it had some 
commands I liked. However I did not want the bot to respond to 
public !commands, so I removed or disabled them.

This copy will Not respond in any way to commands typed in any channel.
This means any interactions need to happen in a msg/query window
or in the partyline.
